What is tar? (in one line)

👉 tar is used to combine many files/folders into one file (and extract them back).
Think of it like a box 📦
Put many files into one box → create tar
Open the box → extract tar
Why the name tar?

tar = Tape Archive
(It was originally used to store files on magnetic tapes.)

Basic tar commands (most common)
1️⃣ Create a tar file (pack files)
tar -cvf archive.tar file1 file2 folder/

What it means:
c → create a new archive
v → verbose (show progress)
f → file name

👉 This puts file1, file2, and folder/ into archive.tar
2️⃣ Extract a tar file (unpack files)
tar -xvf archive.tar
Meaning:

x → extract
v → show files
f → archive file

👉 Files come out of the tar file
3️⃣ View contents without extracting
tar -tvf archive.tar
👉 Just shows what’s inside the tar file

4️⃣ Tar + compression (very common)
Create compressed tar (.tar.gz)
tar -czvf archive.tar.gz folder/
z → gzip compression (smaller size)

Extract compressed tar
tar -xzvf archive.tar.gz

Most common options (easy table)
Option	Meaning
c	create
x	extract
t	list contents
v	show progress
f	file name
z	gzip compression
j	bzip2 compression
