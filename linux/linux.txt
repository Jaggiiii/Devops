sudo apt update  -->Refreshes the package list from internet
sudo apt upgrade  --> Installs the available updates for already installed packages
sudo apt install package  -->  Downloads and installs a new package (software)
sudo apt remove package  ---> Uninstalls a package but keeps its config files (Program files are deleted
👉 Configuration files are NOT deleted)

When you install a package, two types of things are created:
Program files (binary, executable)
Configuration files (settings)
Config files store things like:

ports
usernames
passwords
paths
service behavior
environment settings
They tell the software how to behave.

Use it when:
You may reinstall the package later
You want to keep old settings
You’re testing or upgrading software
On servers where configs are valuable


sudo apt purge package  --> Uninstalls a package and its config files

Use it when:
Package is broken or misconfigured
You want a fresh install
You’ll never use it again
Cleaning old servers / freeing disk
